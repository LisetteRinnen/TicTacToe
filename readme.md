# INFO 314 TicTacToe Client & Server
This is an implementation of a TTTP-compatible for a INFO 314 group homework assignment.

The server is written in Java and the client is written in Python because Frederick volunteered to write the whole client and decided he liked Python more.

## Running the client
The client was tested and working on Python 3.9.11.
1. Run `python3 TicTacToeClient.py`
2. Follow the instructions on screen

## Interoperability
